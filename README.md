# Data-Analytics-Projects:
Certificate : from MDSF Association

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under MDSF-Data Science Project.

MDSF online data science program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, use ML models, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and I am trying to build a portfolio of projects.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.


# Part 1 - Data Wrangeling
Subjects Covered:

    Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python(personally i use conda)
    Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application
    Data Cleaning
    NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
    Pandas Series and Dataframes

## Project 1: Youth Bank Campaign 

A bank has a pool of customers with the following data Customer_dataset.
The bankâ€™s manager wants to launch a youth campaign to encourage young customers (Age<25). As a data scientist, you were asked to do a study describing the provided data.
Use Python to generate an analytical report (+ pandas visualisation) that would help the manager take the right decision regarding the youth campaign.


## Project 2: Urban Park Ranger Animal Condition

This data is collected by NYC from response calls to report animals whom are in danger or in need for assist.
The dataset contains many variables related to the call setting and animal condition. 
The pure aim of this project is to clean as much data as we can, so it could be used later.


# Part 2 - Data Visualization
Subjects Covered:

    Matplotlib 
    Seasborn
    Different charts and graphs
