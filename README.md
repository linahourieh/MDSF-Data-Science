# Data-Analytics-Projects:
Certificate : from MDSF Association

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under MDSF-Data Science Project.

MDSF online data science program prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, use ML models, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and I am trying to build a portfolio of projects.
